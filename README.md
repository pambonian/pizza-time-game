# Pizza-time!

## Overview
This is a side-scrolling browser game project I made, called Pizza Time! I was looking for a theme for this game and saw one of the original early-00's Spider-man movies on my tv, so the idea hit me to bring a scene from those movies into my game (For the full context, I included a clip of it in the page!). The premise of the game is to avoid wild taxis flying towards you, while you deliver pizzas to customers on the street - who (sometimes) pay you tips! If you rake in at least $500 in tips, you win the game. If you hit enough taxis, you lose the game. This was a great exercise to build my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - while simultaneously having a lot of fun with adding some creative flair to the game.
